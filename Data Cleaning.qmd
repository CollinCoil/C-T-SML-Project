```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

carEmissions <- read_csv("table_export.csv", na = "-")
carEmissions <- replace(carEmissions, is.na(carEmissions), 0)
```

Now that I have uploaded the data, I need to filter out the aggregate values, i.e., the values for manufacturer, class, and vehicle type that begin with all.

```{r}
carEmissions <- carEmissions[which(!startsWith(carEmissions$Manufacturer, 'All')), ] 
carEmissions <- carEmissions[which(!startsWith(carEmissions$`Regulatory Class`, 'All')), ]
carEmissions <- carEmissions[which(!startsWith(carEmissions$`Vehicle Type`, 'All')), ]

carEmissions <- carEmissions %>% filter(`Real-World CO2 (g/mi)` > 0)


```

```{r}
write.csv(carEmissions, file = "carEmissions.csv")
```
